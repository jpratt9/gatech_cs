RISC: simplifying contrsaints
a) All ALU OPNs
	Only work on I/O from registers
	**all computation on registers only
b) All memory accesses are through load and store instructions
c) Only 3 instruction formats:
	R-type
	R |OP|RD|RS1|RS2|
	R | Operation code | Destination register | Source register 1 | Source register 2 |
		5 bits		5 bits			5 bits		5 bits

	I-type 
	I |OP|RD|RS|Immed|
	I | Operation Code | Destination Register | Source Register | Immediate Value | 
		5 bits		5 bits			5 bits		16 bits	
	Note that "immediate" is just a value inputted, not a value in a register

	J-type
	J |OP|ADDR|
	Jump and link - if you're doing a subroutine, the "ADDR" becomes the new place to jump to in the program
