Data and graphs can be found in "Q5-8 Data and Figures". A full report (i.e.,
"Analysis"), can be found in "Report.docx".

Additional datasets I generated can be found under "./datasets/" from project
root.

To run Question X, where X is 4-8, do:
	python questionX.py

i.e., to run Question 4, do:
	python question4.py

Please note: I modified NeuralNetUtil.py and Testing.py for the extra credit, as
I felt that this is where my helper functions I created would make the most sense
(rather than just adding them to q7.py and q8.py).The edited section is marked
by a "EXTRA CREDIT" comment block on both files.
