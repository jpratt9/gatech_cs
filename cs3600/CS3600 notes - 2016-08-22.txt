What is intelligence?
- Does not act randomly - acts with purpose
- Can deduce information from observations
- Learning from experience
- The ability to abstract actions (eg, I can walk down any set of stairs, even
    if I haven't walked down them before)

There is no consensus on what intelligence is.

We will build things that seem to be intelligent and can solve our problems and
    avoid the philosophical arguments.

An entity is intelligent if it performs behaviors that a person might reasonably
    believe requires intelligence.
BEHAVIOR is important b/c it matters what the thing does, not what it "thinks"
    Agents - things that act in the world to change it
REASONABLY - most people would agree on it

Turing Test - if you pass this test, regardless of how, you must be intelligent
    If a judge can't tell that a human is pretending to be a computer and a
    computer is pretending to be human, then the computer must be intelligent.
