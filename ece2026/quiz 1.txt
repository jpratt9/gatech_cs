+KEEP phi BETWEEN [-pi, pi]

sinusoid questions
	- you have graph, make eqn
		- match identifying features to cooresponding graph (decay, phase, frequency usually)
	- you have eqn, make graph
		- to find phase:  take t of peak nearest to 0 (tm) multiply by -2pi*f (-w)

operations with complex numbers
	- TREAT "j" like a real number
	- 1/j = -j
